# Hi 👋 I'm Reza

### 🚀 About Me
I am currently learning Data Science with a strong focus on Python and Pandas.

I enjoy building small but real projects to understand data processing, analysis, and basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).

My long-term goal is to grow into an **Applied Data Scientist / ML Engineer** role, with a clear plan to work toward the Swiss job market 🇨🇭.
